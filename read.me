## Ordering

Order influences the execution of the MLEM2 algorithm so it is important to note 
that my attribute-value blocks are ordered such that all attribute-value blocks
for the first attribute (column) are listed, then all of the attribute-value blocks
for the second attribute, and so on. Within each attribute, symbolic data is ordered
alphabetically and numeric data is ordered by ascending cutpoints to maintain 
consistency.
